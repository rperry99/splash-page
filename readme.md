## Thoughts

I learned something pretty important from this project I think. I learned just HOW useful Figma can be. The CSS for this project came together SO fast because it was already styled on Figma.

This project I think was more useful to me learning about Figma more than learning about JavaScript. This project only had a small piece of JS. I think after this project, I am going to start using Figma to plan out my projects before I dig right into the code.
